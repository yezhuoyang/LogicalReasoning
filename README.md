# LogicalReasoning
This is the big project of my NLP course.

My goal is to design a model to fit the Reclor dataset.

In doing this project, I'm trying to answer the following question

1. How to understand the given questions?

2. How to extraction logic relation in the text?

3. What role does the pretraining model play?

4. How to improve the score of each model?
